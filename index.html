        <p>My favorite movie is called The Gallows, its a horror themed movie. I really like it because when it came
            out, I remember i was like 13 years old and it scared me a lot. Some of my old friends watched it with me,
            all of us were pretty scared. <br>

            My name is Marvin, I'm 18 years old, although people tell me I look younger but it is what it is. I consider
            my self to be a caring, friendly, quiet person, I don't really speak out unless I have to, for example in
            cass. I can speak Spanish which is my main language, I grew up in a spanish speaking family, English is my
            secondary language thats why I struggle with it sometimes. I have 2 siblings, an older sister and a younger
            brother. I really like playing video games, soccer, listening to music, sometimes take walks and hanging out with friends.
